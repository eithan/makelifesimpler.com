  "content": "<p>The Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is the closest thing to hiring a cleaning service without actually hiring one. It vacuums carpets with 6000Pa suction, mops hard floors with a vibrating pad, and when it's done, it returns to its dock to empty the dustbin, wash the mop pads, and dry them with hot air.</p><p>The obstacle avoidance uses a camera plus structured light, so it dodges shoes, cables, and pet toys without getting stuck. You can set room-specific cleaning schedules and no-mop zones through the app. It even lifts the mop pad when it detects carpet.</p><p>Is it expensive? Yes. But if you value your time at anything above minimum wage, it pays for itself within months. Four hours a week of cleaning, reclaimed. That's 200+ hours a year you get back for things that actually matter.</p>",
