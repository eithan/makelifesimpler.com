  "content": "<p>Perplexity AI reimagines search. Instead of a list of blue links, you get a direct, well-sourced answer to your question. It reads multiple sources, synthesizes the information, and presents it with inline citations so you can verify everything.</p><p>The Pro tier adds more powerful AI models, file uploads, and image generation. But even the free version is remarkably useful for research, fact-checking, and learning. Ask it anything from \"what's the best budget standing desk\" to \"explain quantum computing\" and get a concise, cited response.</p><p>What makes Perplexity special is the focus on accuracy over creativity. Every claim is backed by a source. You can click through to read the original articles, follow up with clarifying questions, and build a collection of research threads. It's the tool that finally makes AI search trustworthy.</p>",
