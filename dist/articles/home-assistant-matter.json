  "content": "<p>Home Assistant is the open-source brain of a truly smart home. It runs locally on your network, connects to over 2,000 integrations, and gives you a single dashboard for everything \u2014 lights, thermostats, cameras, locks, sensors, and more. No cloud required, no subscription fees.</p><p>The addition of Matter support is a game-changer. Matter is a universal smart home protocol backed by Apple, Google, Amazon, and Samsung. Devices that support Matter work across all platforms automatically. Home Assistant's Matter integration means you can buy any Matter-certified device and it just works \u2014 no more checking compatibility lists.</p><p>The automation engine is where Home Assistant really shines. Set up rules like \"turn off all lights when everyone leaves\" or \"start the robot vacuum when nobody's home\" using a visual editor or YAML. Combine it with voice assistants, presence detection, and energy monitoring for a home that truly runs itself.</p>",
