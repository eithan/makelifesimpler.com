  "content": "<p>Wise (formerly TransferWise) solves the hidden fee problem with international money transfers. Banks typically mark up exchange rates by 3-5% on top of their transfer fees. Wise uses the mid-market rate \u2014 the real one you see on Google \u2014 and charges a small, transparent fee upfront. For a $1,000 transfer, you might save $30-50 compared to a traditional bank.</p><p>The multi-currency account is where it gets powerful. You get local bank details in USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, and more \u2014 meaning you can receive payments like a local in those countries. Freelancers and remote workers use this to avoid conversion fees entirely by invoicing in the client's currency.</p><p>The debit card spends in any currency at the real exchange rate, making it the best travel card for most people. Auto-conversions let you set target rates and convert automatically when the market hits your number.</p>",
