  "content": "<p>The Anker USB-C Charging Station is the antidote to cable chaos. It has multiple USB-C and USB-A ports with enough power to fast-charge your laptop, phone, tablet, and earbuds simultaneously. One device, one cable to the wall, everything charged.</p><p>The GaN (Gallium Nitride) technology keeps it compact despite the high wattage output. It's smaller than most laptop chargers but powers your entire desk. Smart power distribution automatically allocates wattage based on what's connected \u2014 plug in a laptop and it gets priority, add a phone and it shares intelligently.</p><p>Build quality is excellent with surge protection, temperature control, and overvoltage protection built in. It works with everything that charges via USB \u2014 Apple, Samsung, laptops, Switch, Steam Deck, you name it. The best part? It eliminates 4-5 separate chargers and their wall warts from your setup.</p>",
