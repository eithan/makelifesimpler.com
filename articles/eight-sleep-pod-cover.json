  "content": "<p>The Eight Sleep Pod Cover turns any mattress into a smart bed. It circulates water through a thin layer to heat or cool each side independently — so you can sleep at 68°F while your partner sleeps at 74°F. No more thermostat wars.</p><p>The real intelligence is in the adaptive algorithm. It learns your sleep patterns and automatically adjusts temperature through the night — cooler during deep sleep, warmer before your wake-up time. The gentle thermal alarm replaces jarring phone alarms.</p><p>Sleep tracking rivals dedicated devices like Oura, measuring heart rate, HRV, respiratory rate, and sleep stages. Users consistently report 20-30% improvement in sleep scores within the first month. At the price of a good mattress, it's a health investment that pays dividends every single night.</p>",
