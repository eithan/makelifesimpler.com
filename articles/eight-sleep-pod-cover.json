  "content": "<p>The Eight Sleep Pod Cover turns any mattress into a smart bed. It circulates water through a thin layer to heat or cool each side independently — from 55°F to 110°F. If you've ever fought over the thermostat at night, this solves it permanently.</p><p>The AI-powered Autopilot feature learns your sleep patterns and automatically adjusts temperature throughout the night. It cools you down for deep sleep, warms you up before your alarm, and adapts to seasonal changes. The companion app shows detailed sleep metrics including heart rate, HRV, respiratory rate, and sleep stages.</p><p>It's not cheap, but the impact on sleep quality is dramatic. Better sleep improves everything — energy, focus, mood, recovery. If you're serious about optimizing your health, temperature-controlled sleep is the highest-ROI investment you can make.</p>",
