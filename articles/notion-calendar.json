  "editorsNote": "Reddit's r/Notion users note that Notion Calendar (formerly Cron) is still missing Outlook calendar sync, which is a dealbreaker for people in corporate environments. The Notion database integration is also somewhat limited — only simple databases sync well. Most say if you're already in the Notion ecosystem, it's a no-brainer replacement for Google Calendar's cluttered UI.",
  "content": "<h3>How to stop double-booking yourself and losing track of your week</h3><p>Your calendar is a mess. Work meetings are in Google Calendar, personal events are in Apple Calendar, your project deadlines live in Notion, and your scheduling links are in Calendly. You double-book because you're checking multiple places. You forget tasks because they're in a project board, not on your calendar. And every time someone asks \"when are you free?\", you spend 5 minutes cross-referencing apps before responding. The average knowledge worker spends 12 minutes per day just managing their calendar — that's an entire workday per year lost to scheduling logistics.</p><p>Notion Calendar (formerly Cron) merges your calendar with your project management into a single interface. It syncs with Google Calendar, pulls tasks directly from Notion databases, and includes built-in scheduling links that replace Calendly for most use cases. When someone books a slot through your scheduling link, it blocks your calendar in real-time across all synced calendars. The key differentiator from Google Calendar or Fantastical is the deep Notion integration: tasks from your Notion databases appear as schedulable items that you drag onto time slots, and completing them in either place syncs automatically.</p><p>The standout features for simplifying daily life are the keyboard-first design (every action has a shortcut — power users navigate their entire week without touching a mouse), native multi-timezone support (essential for remote teams — see meeting times in all participants' zones simultaneously), and the Mac menu bar widget that shows your next event and daily agenda at a glance without opening any app. The scheduling links alone save 5-10 minutes per meeting arranged, since you just share a link instead of the \"how about Tuesday at 3?\" email volley. Combined with <a href=\"article.html?id=github-copilot\">GitHub Copilot</a> for developers who need to protect deep work blocks, Notion Calendar becomes the command center for your productive hours.</p><p>The real-world impact is reclaiming the 12+ minutes daily spent on scheduling overhead — that's 60+ hours per year. More importantly, the visual integration of tasks and events means nothing falls through the cracks: if it's in Notion, it's on your calendar. Users report fewer missed deadlines, fewer double-bookings, and significantly less context-switching between tools. Notion Calendar is free for individual use, making it one of the few productivity tools on this site with zero financial barrier. The scheduling links feature alone replaces a $12/month Calendly subscription.</p><h3>⚡ Set it up in 5 minutes</h3><ol><li>Download Notion Calendar from notion.so/product/calendar (Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, or web)</li><li>Sign in with your Google account to sync your existing Google Calendar</li><li>Connect your Notion workspace to pull in databases as schedulable tasks</li><li>Set up a scheduling link for meetings — share the URL instead of playing email tag</li><li>Install the menu bar widget (Mac) for a glanceable daily agenda</li></ol>",
