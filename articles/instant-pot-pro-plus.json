  "content": "<p>The Instant Pot Pro Plus is the Swiss Army knife of kitchen appliances. It pressure cooks, slow cooks, sautés, steams, sous vides, air fries, dehydrates, and more — all in one device. It replaces a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, yogurt maker, steamer, and air fryer.</p><p>Pressure cooking is the star feature. Meals that normally take hours are done in 30 minutes. Throw in frozen chicken, rice, and vegetables — dinner's ready before you finish answering emails. The app has hundreds of guided recipes with automatic time and pressure settings.</p><p>The build quality is excellent, cleanup is easy (the inner pot is dishwasher safe), and the safety features are robust — 13 safety mechanisms prevent the lid from opening while pressurized. It's the single most useful kitchen appliance for anyone who wants to eat well without spending hours cooking.</p>",
